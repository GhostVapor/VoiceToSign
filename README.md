# About
This system aims to help people who frequently interact with mute individuals, such as those who are newly deaf or mute and have trouble expressing themselves. The system uses advanced technology like machine learning and speech 
recognition to provide a direct chat feature. Through the app's user interface, users can speak, and their words are converted into text and then into sign language.
